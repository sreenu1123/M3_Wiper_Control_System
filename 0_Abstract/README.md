The wiper systems are operated from a control panel, typically mounted with good access from the operator’s position. From the control panel the wiper 
are switched on and off, and the wiper speed and intermittent settings are adjusted.
Wiper works by removing oil, dust, rainwater, and dirt that get stuck to the windshield.If there are no wipers, the rainwater that wets the glass will condense and the condition of the glass will become unclear. 
Not only that, dirt that sticks to the wind shield for a long time, of course, is very difficult to remove. If left untreated, will hinder the driver’s view and create a high risk of driving accident.
When the wiper switch is in the off position, the wiper will not function. When the wiper switch is in low-speed mode, the wiper will work at low speed. Accordingly, when the wiper switch is in high-speed mode, the wiper will work at a fairly high speed.
