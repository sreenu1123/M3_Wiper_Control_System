# M3_WIPER_CONTROL_SYSTEM


### WORKING PROCESS
* When the button is pressed ONCE, the car will be on ACC mode.

* When the button is pressed TWICE, the car will be on Ignition mode.

* When the button is pressed THREE times, wiper turn on.

* When the button is pressed FOUR times, wiper turn off.

# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
* STM32 IDE

# COMPONENTS:
* STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD

# DESCRIPTION:
* The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family is based on the high-performance Arm速 Cortex速-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family incorporates high-speed embedded

# STM32F407VG:
* The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family depends on the superior execution Arm速 Cortex速-M4 32-digit RISC center working at a recurrence of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 center highlights a Floating point unit (FPU) single accuracy which upholds all Arm single-accuracy information handling directions and information types. It likewise executes a full arrangement of DSP directions and a memory insurance unit (MPU) which upgrades application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family integrates fast installed.

# Xpack Packages:
* Windows Build Tools: The xPack Windows Build Tools is a standalone Windows binary distribution of GNU make and a few of other tools required by the Eclipse Embedded CDT (formerly GNU MCU/ARM Eclipse) project, but the binaries can also be used in generic build environments.

# OpenOCD:
* Open On-Chip Debugger (OpenOCD) is a free, open-source project that aims to provide debugging, in-system programming, and boundary scan using a debug adapter. The adapter is a hardware module that provides the right signals for the target to understand.

# QEMU:
* The xPack QEMU Arm is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of QEMU, with several extensions for Arm Cortex-M devices.


# FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER:
* Adaptable static memory regulator supporting Compact Flash, SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND recollections.
* 512 bytes of OTP memory.
* Up to 192+4 Kbytes of SRAM including 64-Kbyte of CCM (core coupled memory) data RAM.
* Up to 1 Mbyte of Flash memory.


# USES:
# 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW)

# WHAT:
* The functional speed of a vehicle wiper is constrained by a wiper speed control instrument in view of downpour conditions. To produce, the control framework consolidates a downpour sensor (30) that identifies downpour conditions. The plentifulness of a simple sign relies upon the distinguished downpour conditions.

# WHY:
* To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times. 
* The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.

# WHO:
* A wiper speed control framework for a car deals with the wiper's working velocity in light of weather patterns.

# HOW:
* You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall.
# WHERE:
* In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:

* Low Budget
* Good Reputation
* High Bargaining Power Supliers
* Big Influence on the Market

# WEAKNESS:
* Structural Inertia
* High Transaction Cost
* No Focus on Private Sector
* Week Focus on Process Innovations

# OPPRONUTIES:
* Technological Lock in of Product
* Technological Development
* Demand for Saver Equipments
* Emerging New Markets

# THREATS:
* Econimical Crisis
* Low Bargaining Power Buyers
* Ethical Pressure
* Highly REgulated Industry
